       <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
       <p class="text-justify">
           Congun.com INC ("Congun") provides an online marketplace for equipment rentals and sales. This Privacy Policy describes Congun’s commitments to you with respect to Congun's use of information collected in connection with our marketplace.</p>
          <p class="text-justify"> While Congun may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, we will always abide by the terms of the Congun in place when we collected your information. Please note, if we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will provide you with notice concerning the changes either on this page or through some other reasonable method.

       </p>

       <h4>Information We Collect</h4>
       <p class="text-justify">As used in this Privacy Policy, the term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or other account number). Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when that information is linked to other personal information that identifies the individual. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Congun marketplace or about a group or category of products, services or users, if all personal information has been removed.</p>
       <p class="text-justify">Upon making your first rental or upon making your equipment available for rent on the Congun marketplace, we will ask you for certain personal information including your name, contact information, state driver's license number, and the last four digits of your social security number (the latter is not stored) for identity verification purposes. When you lend equipment on Congun we additionally will ask for information regarding your equipment and the necessary financial information to facilitate payment to you and to process any filings required by applicable tax authorities.</p>
